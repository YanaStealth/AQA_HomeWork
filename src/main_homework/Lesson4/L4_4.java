/*4. Create a class Calculator. It should have three fields: double firstValue, double secondValue and String operation.
Create all required constructors to properly initialize your object. Consider the case when user does not provide
any parameters when creates a new object. Write a method "calculate" that takes these two values and return
the result of the calculation according to the operation. Write the test class which contains the main method.
In this main method you should create your Calculator object and do some calculation to test your code,
by calling your "calculate" method. Print all results to the console. */
