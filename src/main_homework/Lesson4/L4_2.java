/*2. Implement the method fight() depending on weight, strength and age of the boxer:
You should write dependency by yourself. The method should return true or false if our boxer won or lost.
public class Boxer {
    public int age;
    public int weight;
    public int strength;
    public Boxer(int age, int weight, int strength) {
        this.age = age;
        this.weight = weight;
        this.strength = strength;
    }
    public boolean fight(Boxer anotherBoxer) {
        // write your code here
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}
Requirements:
a) if ourBoxer.fight(anotherBoxer) returns true, then anotherBoxer.fight(outBoxer) should return false;
