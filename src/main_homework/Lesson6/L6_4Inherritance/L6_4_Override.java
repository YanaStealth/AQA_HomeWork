/*4) Create a class A. Add several fields, two methods and parameterized constructors to it.
        Create a class B that extends class A.
        Demonstrate in you program how class's B constructor should call class's A constructor to create a new object.
        Override one method of the class A to fully change it's behavior.
        Override another method to add some extra functionality to it, but it should then call class's A method.
        Create a test class and create several objects of class A and class B and call their methods.*/
